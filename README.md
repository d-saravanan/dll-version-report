# dll-version-report
It is a big and a challenging task when it comes to upgrading a huge application that contains myriads of projects in the solution. This introduces a huge delay in figuring out which project has what version of the assemblies in the references section and then taking an inventory of them and then heading to the upgrade. This tedious process hinted me to develop a small application that scans through my solution in seconds and prepares the list of assemblies and their versions so that I can upgrade with ease. 

Hope this helps ones that manage very large enterprise applications
